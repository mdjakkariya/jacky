"""In-session slash commands: parse a ``/name args`` line and dispatch it.

Commands are pure — they return a :class:`CommandResult` the UI shell enacts (print a
message, clear the transcript, or exit) — so they're testable without a UI and reused by
any shell. This module only owns parsing plus the client-side trio (``/help``, ``/clear``,
``/exit``); the daemon-backed commands (``/diff``, ``/undo``, ``/model``, ``/autonomy``,
``/sessions``, ``/new``) are handled by the ``coder_commands`` handler layer.
